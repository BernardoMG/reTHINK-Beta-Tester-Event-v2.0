Most of the time I dedicated to the hackaton (not full-time, be aware) was spent reading code and documentation.","4","The knowledge of the framework is necessary in order to design a solution to an open challenge: knowing the limitations of focusing the development on the hyperty level and to avoid having to spend most time in what it is not required.","16h","Very useful","Although useful it was difficult to navigate through the concepts.","The Getting Started tab of the website does not provide a good begining to a new user. The gap between developing a hypery and protostub is too big. Between these two, dataObject configuration could be better explained as well as accompanying step by step the development of a more complex hyperty (mote complex than Hello World but still simple).","After understanding the necessary concepts, it all went well.","The biggest problem in this challenge was to have an idea of application to fit the requirement of the challenge: develop a hyperty. Was constantly in ""fear"" of having to tweak protostubs or other parts, although a deep reading about the framework eventually made things more clear. 

Also, having an application thought of: 
 -what is the logic that is supposed to be part of the hyperty or the application?
 - for my application, should I use one reporter per user (and each has a set of observers for all reporters) or should one user have one reporter and the other observers while communication through dataChilds?

reTHINK is a complex framework and open ideas gain in being debated and well designed before being implemented. Probably one extra session in between for a participant to explain his/her idea and how he/she thinks to implement it, in order to receive feedback and knowing for sure what concepts to explore, is a better approach for an open challenge.

It's a simple app, using the existing helloWorld schemas. It consists on a reporter, rotating an arrow, while the observer sees his arrow moving according to the reporter.","It's a simple Jquery that updates the css of the arrow image, and uses the rethink framework to communicate the angle of that rotation between reporter and observer.","2","Most of my time was spent in learning how to use the framework.","4","I don't have much experience with distributed systems, I suppose some of my struggle was regarding in using for what rather than how to do.","20 hours","Not very useful","I found several sources for doc and examples. Some of wich were outdated or using deprecated functions."," I know there are already plans for cleaning the documentation. I'd suggest having more schemas and examples using them.","My app is simple enough that it was easy to re-use the hello world example. I had problems but were novice mistakes, and as far as I know, the framework is working great and allows for much better features.","","4"
